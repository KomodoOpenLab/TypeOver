<h1>What is TypeOver?</h1>
<p>TypeOver is an iOS application that facilitates typing with an external switch interface such as the Tecla Shield. The application consists of a keypad like you would find on a mobile phone. When you select a key, that key then cycles through the letters on the key. So, say you select the 'wxyz 9' key. It'll first say 'w' on the key, then after an amount of time it'll change to 'x', then 'y' etc. When the letter or number that you want appears, you select the key again.</p>
<p>Typing is faster with word prediction. Word prediction is deeply integrated into the application.</p>
<p>TypeOver is customisable. There are multiple settings so you can tailor it to fit your needs. These settings include manual dwell time, shorthand prediction, auto predict and font size.</p>
<h1>Limitations of this build</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, the application doesn't have any speech functionality. This is coming soon.</li>
  <li>Word prediction is unable to add new words. This is something we are working on.</li>
  <li>The user interface is rather mundane. We are pleased to say this is a temporary look.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Known issues</h1>
<p>Depending on the dwell time (the rate at which the keypad keys cycle through their content), there is a potential to miss the desired letter or number because the application doesn't know that the switch or other input device is being held to make a selection. We are working on this but for this build we advise you to enable manual dwell time (see below) to get a comfortable rate.</p>
<h1>Settings explained</h1>
<h2><p>Manual dwell time</p></h2>
<p>Dwell time is the rate at which the keypad keys cycle through their content. Manual dwell time is off by default in TypeOver. When it's off the dwell time is set at the same rate that your Tecla Shield scans at.</p>
<h2><p>Shorthand prediction</p></h2>
<p>Shorthand prediction is exactly what it sounds like. You can just type key letters from the word you want and word prediction will guess what you want. For example, you could type 'pbl' and word prediction would predict 'probably'. Not everybody will want this so by default it's off.</p>
<h2><p>Auto predict</p></h2>
<p>Auto predict gives you the option to automatically display word prediction after you type a certain amount of letters. The default amount of letters is two but this can be changed to any number from one to four.</p>
<h2><p>Font size</p></h2>
<p>Font size refers to the size of the text you type.</p>
